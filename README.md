- No database needed. All data is stored in GitHub Discussions. :octocat:
- GitHub themes: light, dark, dark dimmed, and more! 🌗
- Only ~40KB total chunks size. ⚡
- Automatically fetches new comments and edits from GitHub. 🔃
- Can be self-hosted! 🤳

> **Note:**\
> giscus is still under active development. GitHub is also still actively developing Discussions and its API. Thus, some features of giscus may break or change over time.

## how it works

When giscus loads, the [GitHub Discussions search API][search-api] is used to find the Discussion associated with the page based on a chosen mapping (URL, `pathname`, `<title>`, etc.). If a matching discussion cannot be found, the giscus bot will automatically create a discussion the first time someone comments.

To comment, visitors must authorize the [giscus app][giscus-app] to [post on their behalf][authorization] using the GitHub OAuth flow. Alternatively, visitors can comment on the GitHub Discussion directly. You can moderate the comments on GitHub.
