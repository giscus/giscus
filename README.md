# [giscus][giscus]

A comments system powered by [GitHub Discussions][discussions]. Let visitors leave comments and reactions on your website via GitHub! Heavily inspired by [utterances][utterances].

- [Open source][repo]. 🌏
- No tracking, no ads, always free. 📡 🚫
- No database needed. All data is stored in GitHub Discussions. :octocat:
- Supports [custom themes][creating-custom-themes]! 🌗
- [Extensively configurable][advanced-usage]. 🔧
- Automatically fetches new comments and edits from GitHub. 🔃
- [Can be self-hosted][self-hosting]! 🤳

> **Note:**\
> giscus is still under active development. GitHub is also still actively developing Discussions and its API. Thus, some features of giscus may break or change over time.

## how it works

When giscus loads, the [GitHub Discussions search API][search-api] is used to find the Discussion associated with the page based on a chosen mapping (URL, `pathname`, `<title>`, etc.). If a matching discussion cannot be found, the giscus bot will automatically create a discussion the first time someone leaves a comment or reaction.

To comment, visitors must authorize the [giscus app][giscus-app] to [post on their behalf][authorization] using the GitHub OAuth flow. Alternatively, visitors can comment on the GitHub Discussion directly. You can moderate the comments on GitHub.

<!-- configuration -->

If you're using giscus, consider [starring 🌟 giscus on GitHub][repo] and adding the [`giscus`][giscus-topic] topic [to your repository][topic-howto]! 🎉

## advanced usage

You can add additional configurations (e.g. allowing specific origins) by following the [advanced usage guide][advanced-usage].

## migrating

If you've previously used other systems that utilize GitHub Issues (e.g. [utterances][utterances], [gitalk][gitalk]), you can [convert the existing issues into discussions][convert]. After the conversion, just make sure that the mapping between the discussion titles and the pages are correct, then giscus will automatically use the discussions.
